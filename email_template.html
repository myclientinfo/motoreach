				<h3>Great news!</h3>

				<p><b>mymotoreach.com has begun to launch now. We are promoting the site through digital channels such as Google and Facebook as we finalise our advertising strategy, and you will be seeing increasing numbers of vehicles coming through.</b></p>
				
				<p>Remember, these are members of the public who are selling a car, which will be a good source of prime stock for your yard. However, as we know that 70% of people selling a car are replacing it, there is also potential to sell a vehicle to a member of the public as well. We recommend all trades be considered as a potential sales prospect as well.</p>
				
				<p>Additionally, we are now finalising facilities to allow you to receive vehicle notifications via SMS. If you would like to use this functionality, which would allow you to see new listings while in the yard or on the road, let us know.</p>
				
				<p>We are currently in the process of expanding across Australia, so if you have network partners in Melbourne or Sydney that you want to get involved, please contact us regarding them.</p>
				
				<p>For more information take a look at the <a href="http://www.mymotoreach.com">mymotoreach.com</a> website.</p>
