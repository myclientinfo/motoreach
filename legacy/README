Introduction
===========
Auction Framework is an Open Source PHP application under 
the GPL license, developped by Vickie Comrie, Nicolas Connault
and Christopher Vance. It is not intended to compete with such
auction sites as Ebay, but is intended to be included as a module
in a wider web application, and was created as a silent auction
for Operation USA, a charitable organisation. 

Although the Framework supports many features of auction 
websites, it does not support secure transactions, and is only 
meant to serve as a third-party tool between internet users and
the company/group organising the auction. Once bids have been 
processed, all other transactions, including payments and shipping, 
are handled outside of the Auction Framework.

The Auction Framework holds data about customers which could be
considered sensitive, but not vital: contact details and addresses are
stored, but not banking or other financial information is held. This means
that, should you implement this framework, you will need to carefully
consider the inclusion of a privacy statement somewhere on your
website.

The Auction Framework uses two major libraries which have their own
copyrights, licenses and authors, and we (the developers) do not modify
or take responsibility for this code in any way. These libraries are the
Smarty template engine and the AdoDB database abstraction layer, found
respectively in auction/libs/Smarty-2.6.6 and auction/libs/adodb. You can
find the documentations for these libraries in auction/doc.

The Auction Framework is a work in progress, and we hope to include
many more features in the future. We would appreciate bug reports and
feedback from users of this Framework, as well as a contribution of 
talents in design and development.

Internet Links for Auction Framework Project
======================================

The project isn't currently hosted by SourceForge or on a forum, but
this will be done shortly.


Requirements
===============
PHP >4.x
MySQL


Installation steps
==================
1. Untar or unzip the files anywhere in your web root (keeping the directory
structure intact).

2. If under Linux, chmod 777 the following folders:
	. auction/templates
	. auction/templates_c
	. auction/logs
	. auction/cache
	. auction/images

3. Run the SQL in auction/sql/auction.sql through your database to set up
	the tables.  After this is complete, run the SQL in auction-data.sql to
	load the sample data. Alternatively, use auction_blank.sql to set up an
	empty database and populate it yourself. You'll need to create a new auction
	first using the admin panel.

4. Change the DSN in include.php file to match your database needs. The
	default uses mysql, but you can use any of the databases supported by
	AdoDB : Access, Ado, Firebird, ibase, Informix, ldap, mssql, mysql, postgresql,
	oci8, ODBC, Oracle, SQLite and Sybase, to name just a few. Be sure to enter the
	username and password needed to access the database. Check the AdoDB
	documentation (auction/doc/adodb.chm) for more information on usage.

5. Log on to the admin panel (auction/admin.php) to edit settings.  The default
	administrator is accessed with the following:
Alias (username): root
Password: administrator

6. Modify auction/css/index.css to change the style of the main index page (index.php)
	and modify inner.css to style the inner pages.  Modify the templates in
	auction/templates to change the look and feel of the framework. You will find
	instructions on how to modify the smarty templates in the Smarty manual
	(auction/doc/smarty.chm).

That's it!  Feel free to explore the auction site and create user accounts to bid and
contribute items. To get you started, the three sample users are included with this beta.
They are "user1" "user2" and "user3". These three accounts all use "password" as their password.



Known Issues
==============
1. admin_auction.php: When editing configuration settings for the silent auction, updating the
settings results in error notices being printed at the top of the screen.  The development team
needs to review the origin of these messages.

2. Many of the links in the footer section of the site have not been defined.

3. editaccount.php: When logged in, the layout appears to break in Firefox.

Development and Support
=========================
This will be done through the forum/blog, which is not yet in place. You may also
check the FAQ document which comes with this distribution.
