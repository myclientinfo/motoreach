[28-07-2005]
* Extensive changes across the entire auction framework to ensure that variables were valid
   before being acted on or being used to set Smarty variables.

[27-07-2005]
* Updated Item::updateItem() to only update the fields which were passed in.  Previously, the
   name, category, auction length, and description were all updated.  If the corresponding
   variable was not passed in, the update would set the field to be blank.  The updated code
   addresses this problem.
* Corrected errors which appeared with the beta-2 release.  After seeing these errors on the
   development version of the site, the beta-2 code was removed for download pending a fix.
* Fixed errors identified with beta-2 code.

[01-07-2005]
* Implement a "Change listing" button.  admin_edititem.php.  Completed sometime before July 2005.

[23-06-2005]
* Admin page for organisation details (these are stored in DB and used for payment processing)

[20-06-2005]
* Implement all settings from admin_auction.php

[15-06-2005] (date of last changes)
* Users page: Optionally displays a seller/buyer's info
* Implement user's page with e-mailing functionality : sellers looking at bidder's
   info and vice-versa
* Implement admin panel (CRUD : Create, Read, Update, Delete)
	Proposed structure: 5 main panels
		1. Auction : Main panel where all auction options are configured
		2. Items: edit items that are on for auction
		3. Users: communicate with users (and take action like ban)
		4. Bids: Review / edit bids, send emails
		5. Messages: View and edit messages
	More panels may be added later with new functionality
* Implement reserve price functionality
* Implement admin panel (create/delete auctions/items/users/bids)

[18-02-2005]
* Auction settings: provide more information display control: checkboxes with
	seller/bidder/item details (more specific)

[17-02-2005]
* Added validating methods to validate class

* Very significantly modified the auction class: 
	- No more auction_auctions table in DB
	- Items are no longer linked to the auction Item/table
	- Only one auction is run at a time, without creating or deleting functionality
	- Auction's member variables are all pulled out of admin_config table

* Entered many new messages in the auction_messages table

* Created pages for admin panel:
	- admin_auction.php
	- admin_bids.php
	- admin_index.php
	- admin_items.php
	- admin_login.php
	- admin_messages.php
	- admin_users.php
	
* And their corresponding tpl pages:
	- admin_auction.tpl
	- admin_bids.tpl
	- admin_index.tpl
	- admin_items.tpl
	- admin_login.tpl
	- admin_messages.tpl
	- admin_users.tpl

* Completed login, messages and template for auction pages
* admin_auction.tpl is the first page to be entirely I18N ready: all text
	is entered using message constants
* admin_messages.php is a very fast and efficient way to add, edit and delete
	constant messages.

[31-01-2005]
The following terms are defined:

Seller: The provider of the item for auction
Host: The organisation/person hosting and running the auction. May be the sole recipient of proceeds.
Bidder: The person bidding (not necessarily purchasing) the item

In an effort to make this framework customisable and adaptable, it is proposed that the following
configuration options be implemented. 

	- Bid amount:
		o Bid amount is restricted by the item's increment value, which value is:
			() The same for all items across the whole auction
			() Chosen by the seller
			() Varies in proportion to the starting price of the item
		o Bid amount is chosen by the bidder
	
	- Bidder's access to seller information:
		o The bidder has full access to the seller's contact details
		o The bidder has limited access to the seller's details
		o The bidder has no access to the seller's details because
			the entity or organisation hosting the auction is the sole "seller" of the items
	
	- Bidder's access to item information:
		o The bidder can see all the information that is available about a given item
		o The bidder cannot see: (multiple flags allowed)
			() The starting price of the item
			() The number of bids
			() The reserve value
			() The current price
			() The increment value
			() The end date of the item (not recommended)
			
	- Seller's access to information about bids on his/her items:
		o The seller can access all information about the bids
		o The seller cannot see: (multiple flags allowed)
			() The details of the bidder
			() The number of bids on the item
			() The winner of the item
	
	- Type of auction:
		o Transactions occur between sellers and bidders, the host is only a provider of the auction service
		o The items are "donated" by "sellers", the proceeds go straight to the Host
		o Other options?
	
	- Show item winner or not?
	- Length of time for which expired items are held in database before being deleted
